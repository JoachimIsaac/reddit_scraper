When I watched it I kept being like okay I get not wanting people to see you masturbate especially classmates..and as the tasks kept getting more intense I kept reverting back to that and was like well I guess now they also have proof of other crimes heâ€™s committed but it was revealed it was CP I was blown away. I think itâ€™s because itâ€™s rare to see pedophiles depicted as people in their late teens but totally valid. But in pure height of black mirror greatness all the sudden so much made sense especially them focusing on interaction with a little girl he has in the beginning and the creepy way he stares after you know ugh. Love this episode and white bear,High,Positive,Sentiment,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,1
I have thought about this episode every single day since it first came out. mind uploading into a digital hell/prison is such a terrifying concept especially when there are people in our world today actively working on the development of certain parts of that technology. if scientists ever do crack the code and figure out digital â€œimmortalityâ€ then we have all the pieces to literally send people to hell. people scoff at the plausibility but our modern day tech is the science fiction of our not so distant past. I wish I never saw this episode or any of the other â€œcookieâ€ episodes it really fucking scares me,Negative ,Neutral,Sentiment,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,2
"I know this post is old, but I just watched the episode and I have to disagree.Â 

If Nida is an unreliable narrator, and what other people see is reality, then we have to accept that the nuclear attacks happened. Nida wasnâ€™t present when the others saw the bombs. She could have just been imagining it, but if we open that up as a possibility, then literally anything that happened the whole episode could have been imagined. Everything could just be a dream and pointless. Thereâ€™s a difference between something being left ambiguous and a story lacking internal logic that makes it indeciferable.

If they wanted it left as ambiguous as to whether it was all in Nidaâ€™s head, they would have only have shown the explosions only through Nidaâ€™s POV in the interrogation room. They intentionally chose not to do that. So either they wanted to establish the bombs dropped or they made a mess of a story.

Also, the endless void canâ€™t be a metaphor for death when Nida explicitly described it as a metaphor for her life.

The point of the story is about Consequentialism vs Nonconsequentialism. Essentially, could Nida kill a good person to prevent worse things from happening. I think thatâ€™s what sparked the idea for the episode, but they bogged it down with so many other random things it became a mess.

The key point is at the end, when she asks the police officer if heâ€™s a good person. Throughout the story she gradually becomes more corrupted. But she never stops trying to find loopholes to avoid feeling guilt. At the end, the target was the police officer. Gaap tells her, and she refuses. She has motive and opportunity, but she still refuses. But no matter what she tries, she still ends up needing to kill him in order to complete the mission. There, in the field she canâ€™t accept murdering a good man even to prevent Nuclear War and/or a Neo-Nazi movement. And she dooms others with that choice.

Nida never really picks a side. She doesnâ€™t refuse to murder because itâ€™s wrong. She also wonâ€™t murder to avoid worse outcomes. She just keeps looking for loopholes. So she neither perishes in the fire with the others, nor saves the world. She just disappears into oblivion.",Negative,Positive,Sentiment,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,3

I thought the idea of somebody staying sequestered to a single building in a simulation because they were in love was an interesting concept. And what does it say about love and reality? To be in love with something that isnâ€™t truly human but is so close you couldnâ€™t tell the difference? To willingly give up reality for a dream: for something fake.

Yup. I'd add that this appears to be the later version of the technology from _Playtest_.

">Daly was a god in his virtual prisonâ€”it's peculiar that he would die so easily.

I think it was worth noting that Daly, in all his forms, seemed to think of himself as above others, especially women, so he probably wouldn't think of Nanette as a threat to his existence, especially after he'd spent what seemed like 500 years manipulating everything around him. So his defenses are down and she has the surprise on her side.

I think if Brooker had wanted to convey that Daly escaped in some form there would have been more direct clues, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's leaving it open in case of a third installment.

As it stands, I interpret the ending as Daly is dead dead dead, Nanette is a combination of her natural self and her digital clone, and her surviving mates are stuck trapped in her consciousness until she figures a way to get them out - which she may do eventually but right now she just wants a break from having to work for everyone's survival 24/7.

"I actually disagree. Part of what made Eulogy work for me was that the baby wasnâ€™t his.

That absence of connection made the whole situation feel even more alienating and haunting. It reinforced the themes of memory, legacy, and how much (or little) we actually mean to others in the end.

If the baby had been his, it would have shifted the story toward closure and reconciliation, which isnâ€™t really the point of the episode. The coldness of that final reveal hits harder because there's no redemptive twist, itâ€™s just empty. And that's why the scene with him crying, looking at her playing the cello is so much more bittersweet because he knows that this is just something that can't be reconciled. 

It's showing that as much as we can use technology to go back to the past, you can't really go back to fully change the real world and what happened in it, and you can't escape what happened even if you tried to be as thorough as possible and cut out all memories of somebody. It's showing that trauma will still exist and it's up to you to decide how to move on.

"That's pretty much how the mind works. In cultures where female breasts aren't traditionally covered up, they aren't regarded as sexually relevant or any more taboo than a woman's hands. 

Basically, Sara developed obsessions with concepts that were literally censored by a chip in her brain. She can't see violence, so she's obsessed with it. She can't see drugs, so she wants to try them. She can't see sex,  so she couldn't wait to experience it. 

This is why the mom was advised by a psychiatrist to discontinue using the device, but they should have followed up with her. Since it's Black Mirror, they didn't account for a parent getting addicted to the ability to monitor and protect her child. And just because Sara stopped self-harming (she couldn't see blood, but *feeling it* appealed to her, and she might have been able to make out its color if she *drew a ton of blood)* doesn't mean her problems were over. For example, she found it appealing when a teenaged Trick wanted to show porn and extreme violence to a preteen girl, and later jumped at the chance to do drugs and have unprotected sex with Trick when she was 15, and he was probably 17-18.

The surveillance wasn't the only problem. The censoring created real developmental issues that made Sara high-grade reckless, and also apparently unaware of how contraception works.",Neutral,Positive,Sentiment,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,48
Nothing made sense about this episode to me. Even the premise â€œwhat if we could replace an actor from an old classic movie with a current popular actorâ€ makes no sense because I canâ€™t think of why anyone would care about or want to watch something like that. Especially given the fact there is currently already enough technology and CGI to do something like this in a much easier way. I just donâ€™t see the appeal at all of the tech itself and then the way they handled the filming process also didnâ€™t make sense at all. And the way they set up the plot was lazy to me where Issa was like â€œitâ€™s so frustrating I canâ€™t get any good roles where is my hotel reverieâ€ and then conveniently they are looking to remake that exact movie at that exact time and her agent or whoever knows about it. And then the flash drive was supposed to explain everything but they filmed anyways after she didnâ€™t watch it knowing they were throwing her into a very disorienting and confusing and overwhelming environment to do something she was not at all prepared to do. Also arenâ€™t flash drives a bit outdated even in todays world? That bit of tech seemed out of place to me.

They obviously are very serious about their job so I'd like to think what will happen after they get back to Earth. Will they immediately kill each other then? Will they join forces and find cult people and murder them instead? Will they go back to the respective lives and feel dead inside for the rest of their life? Or will they fall in love and forget everything that had happened?,Mixed,Weak,Opinion Strength,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,37

"There are a lot of Easter Eggs and tongue-in-cheek references to other episodes. I've never thought that they were indicators that episodes take place in the same universe, especially since each episode has its own distinct world and feel. I just think it's the writers dropping things in for fans to catch.

Or maybe the episodes take place in the same multiverse, with each episode being in a different universe and sometimes referencing different versions of events that took place in other universes in other episodes.",Strong,Weak,Opinion Strength,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,41

"That's pretty much how the mind works. In cultures where female breasts aren't traditionally covered up, they aren't regarded as sexually relevant or any more taboo than a woman's hands. 

Basically, Sara developed obsessions with concepts that were literally censored by a chip in her brain. She can't see violence, so she's obsessed with it. She can't see drugs, so she wants to try them. She can't see sex,  so she couldn't wait to experience it. 

This is why the mom was advised by a psychiatrist to discontinue using the device, but they should have followed up with her. Since it's Black Mirror, they didn't account for a parent getting addicted to the ability to monitor and protect her child. And just because Sara stopped self-harming (she couldn't see blood, but *feeling it* appealed to her, and she might have been able to make out its color if she *drew a ton of blood)* doesn't mean her problems were over. For example, she found it appealing when a teenaged Trick wanted to show porn and extreme violence to a preteen girl, and later jumped at the chance to do drugs and have unprotected sex with Trick when she was 15, and he was probably 17-18.

The surveillance wasn't the only problem. The censoring created real developmental issues that made Sara high-grade reckless, and also apparently unaware of how contraception works.",Mixed,Strong,Opinion Strength,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,48

Nothing made sense about this episode to me. Even the premise â€œwhat if we could replace an actor from an old classic movie with a current popular actorâ€ makes no sense because I canâ€™t think of why anyone would care about or want to watch something like that. Especially given the fact there is currently already enough technology and CGI to do something like this in a much easier way. I just donâ€™t see the appeal at all of the tech itself and then the way they handled the filming process also didnâ€™t make sense at all. And the way they set up the plot was lazy to me where Issa was like â€œitâ€™s so frustrating I canâ€™t get any good roles where is my hotel reverieâ€ and then conveniently they are looking to remake that exact movie at that exact time and her agent or whoever knows about it. And then the flash drive was supposed to explain everything but they filmed anyways after she didnâ€™t watch it knowing they were throwing her into a very disorienting and confusing and overwhelming environment to do something she was not at all prepared to do. Also arenâ€™t flash drives a bit outdated even in todays world? That bit of tech seemed out of place to me. One of the weakest premises of a black mirror episode to me and one of the weakest executions as well.,Strong,Mixed,Opinion Strength,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,50

I have thought about this episode every single day since it first came out. mind uploading into a digital hell/prison is such a terrifying concept especially when there are people in our world today actively working on the development of certain parts of that technology. if scientists ever do crack the code and figure out digital â€œimmortalityâ€ then we have all the pieces to literally send people to hell. people scoff at the plausibility but our modern day tech is the science fiction of our not so distant past.

"I know this post is old, but I just watched the episode and I have to disagree.Â 

If Nida is an unreliable narrator, and what other people see is reality, then we have to accept that the nuclear attacks happened. Nida wasnâ€™t present when the others saw the bombs. She could have just been imagining it, but if we open that up as a possibility, then literally anything that happened the whole episode could have been imagined. Everything could just be a dream and pointless. Thereâ€™s a difference between something being left ambiguous and a story lacking internal logic that makes it indeciferable.

If they wanted it left as ambiguous as to whether it was all in Nidaâ€™s head, they would have only have shown the explosions only through Nidaâ€™s POV in the interrogation room. They intentionally chose not to do that. So either they wanted to establish the bombs dropped or they made a mess of a story.

Also, the endless void canâ€™t be a metaphor for death when Nida explicitly described it as a metaphor for her life.

The point of the story is about Consequentialism vs Nonconsequentialism. Essentially, could Nida kill a good person to prevent worse things from happening. I think thatâ€™s what sparked the idea for the episode, but they bogged it down with so many other random things it became a mess.

The key point is at the end, when she asks the police officer if heâ€™s a good person. Throughout the story she gradually becomes more corrupted. But she never stops trying to find loopholes to avoid feeling guilt. At the end, the target was the police officer. Gaap tells her, and she refuses. She has motive and opportunity, but she still refuses. But no matter what she tries, she still ends up needing to kill him in order to complete the mission. There, in the field she canâ€™t accept murdering a good man even to prevent Nuclear War and/or a Neo-Nazi movement. And she dooms others with that choice.

Nida never really picks a side. She doesnâ€™t refuse to murder because itâ€™s wrong. She also wonâ€™t murder to avoid worse outcomes. She just keeps looking for loopholes. So she neither perishes in the fire with the others, nor saves the world. She just disappears into oblivion.",Low,High,Plausibility,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,3

"The thing that really made no sense to me was that she was worried about going back in time because sheâ€™s black, and the producers were like donâ€™t worry, they canâ€™t see you, theyâ€™re just a simulation. But then, the lesbian actress fell in love with her? Because she somehow knew she was a woman? Like explain that shit to me. 

I thought the idea of somebody staying sequestered to a single building in a simulation because they were in love was an interesting concept. And what does it say about love and reality? To be in love with something that isnâ€™t truly human but is so close you couldnâ€™t tell the difference? To willingly give up reality for a dream: for something fake. Is that love, or is it weakness?Wouldnâ€™t that have been so interesting? lol the writer was too dumb for anything interesting like that, instead you get a cookie cutter bullshit plot that really doesnâ€™t deserve to be on a show like black mirror",Low,High,Plausibility,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,12

Yup. I'd add that this appears to be the later version of the technology from _Playtest_. It's more robust now, but interrupting the program while it's running and hooked up to someone's brain is still gonna cause issues.

All it took was 4 people with hammers and knives and they took down half of the team aboard this spaceship, which in the 1960s was likely the most sophisticated thing all of humanity had ever created.

">Daly was a god in his virtual prisonâ€”it's peculiar that he would die so easily.

I think it was worth noting that Daly, in all his forms, seemed to think of himself as above others, especially women, so he probably wouldn't think of Nanette as a threat to his existence, especially after he'd spent what seemed like 500 years manipulating everything around him. So his defenses are down and she has the surprise on her side.

I think if Brooker had wanted to convey that Daly escaped in some form there would have been more direct clues, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's leaving it open in case of a third installment.

As it stands, I interpret the ending as Daly is dead dead dead, Nanette is a combination of her natural self and her digital clone, and her surviving mates are stuck trapped in her consciousness until she figures a way to get them out - which she may do eventually but right now she just wants a break from having to work for everyone's survival 24/7.

I don't have a good answer to the cellphone question. Maybe in the hospital Nanette was hooked up to some sort of brainwave monitor that... I don't know.",Low,High,Plausibility,blackmirror_predictions_vs_manu,29

Also, Nanette at the end put the blue disk (the 3rd option) into the PC. How is that they are in her head and not in their normal bodies as her?
