"The biggest plot hole for me is sending the human to space when there are very capable, fully functional replica’s to go. Absolutely shambolic writing. Couldn’t get past that!",Neutral,Weak,Medium,,,
When I watched it I kept being like okay I get not wanting people to see you masturbate especially classmates..and as the tasks kept getting more intense I kept reverting back to that and was like well I guess now they also have proof of other crimes he’s committed but it was revealed it was CP I was blown away. I think it’s because it’s rare to see pedophiles depicted as people in their late teens but totally valid. But in pure height of black mirror greatness all the sudden so much made sense especially them focusing on interaction with a little girl he has in the beginning and the creepy way he stares after you know ugh. Love this episode and white bear,Positive,Strong,High,,,
I have thought about this episode every single day since it first came out. mind uploading into a digital hell/prison is such a terrifying concept especially when there are people in our world today actively working on the development of certain parts of that technology. if scientists ever do crack the code and figure out digital “immortality” then we have all the pieces to literally send people to hell. people scoff at the plausibility but our modern day tech is the science fiction of our not so distant past. I wish I never saw this episode or any of the other “cookie” episodes it really fucking scares me,Neutral,Strong,Low,,,
"I know this post is old, but I just watched the episode and I have to disagree. 

If Nida is an unreliable narrator, and what other people see is reality, then we have to accept that the nuclear attacks happened. Nida wasn’t present when the others saw the bombs. She could have just been imagining it, but if we open that up as a possibility, then literally anything that happened the whole episode could have been imagined. Everything could just be a dream and pointless. There’s a difference between something being left ambiguous and a story lacking internal logic that makes it indeciferable.

If they wanted it left as ambiguous as to whether it was all in Nida’s head, they would have only have shown the explosions only through Nida’s POV in the interrogation room. They intentionally chose not to do that. So either they wanted to establish the bombs dropped or they made a mess of a story.

Also, the endless void can’t be a metaphor for death when Nida explicitly described it as a metaphor for her life.

The point of the story is about Consequentialism vs Nonconsequentialism. Essentially, could Nida kill a good person to prevent worse things from happening. I think that’s what sparked the idea for the episode, but they bogged it down with so many other random things it became a mess.

The key point is at the end, when she asks the police officer if he’s a good person. Throughout the story she gradually becomes more corrupted. But she never stops trying to find loopholes to avoid feeling guilt. At the end, the target was the police officer. Gaap tells her, and she refuses. She has motive and opportunity, but she still refuses. But no matter what she tries, she still ends up needing to kill him in order to complete the mission. There, in the field she can’t accept murdering a good man even to prevent Nuclear War and/or a Neo-Nazi movement. And she dooms others with that choice.

Nida never really picks a side. She doesn’t refuse to murder because it’s wrong. She also won’t murder to avoid worse outcomes. She just keeps looking for loopholes. So she neither perishes in the fire with the others, nor saves the world. She just disappears into oblivion.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
"Their end goal wasn't to leave the game though, that was never on the table, they were trying to comit collective suicide to escape Daly. Yes they're still inside the game, which is basically a whole universe. They're not confined to the ship, we see them visit diferent planets.

"I think dislike of Bête Noire over the tech is from either a lack of imagination or a lack of explanation

For example, imagine reality is a computer simulation, which would be very non-farfetched in regards to tech seen Black Mirror episodes. We've seen simulated worlds there before.

If it's a simulation, then it's not impossible that someone could figure out how to manipulate the simulation - to jump between many simulated universes, rewrite them, etc. 

Their reality could be so ""hackable"" because it isn't reality at all, but a simulation.",Neutral,Weak,Low,,,

This was my favorite episode. The whole facility and 15 million credits plot was probably my favorite little corner of the black mirror universe.

"The thing that really made no sense to me was that she was worried about going back in time because she’s black, and the producers were like don’t worry, they can’t see you, they’re just a simulation. But then, the lesbian actress fell in love with her? Because she somehow knew she was a woman? Like explain that shit to me. 

I thought the idea of somebody staying sequestered to a single building in a simulation because they were in love was an interesting concept. And what does it say about love and reality? To be in love with something that isn’t truly human but is so close you couldn’t tell the difference? To willingly give up reality for a dream: for something fake. Is that love, or is it weakness?Wouldn’t that have been so interesting? lol the writer was too dumb for anything interesting like that, instead you get a cookie cutter bullshit plot that really doesn’t deserve to be on a show like black mirror",Positive,Strong,High,,,

Yup. I'd add that this appears to be the later version of the technology from _Playtest_. It's more robust now, but interrupting the program while it's running and hooked up to someone's brain is still gonna cause issues. And Daly was running a forked modded copy that suddenly got hit with a standard version patch. Yeah, good odds that's gonna crash.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
"Why didn't they have any backups in case this replica thing had an issue? Why was there no security posted on either of their homes when they're involved in some unbelievably high tech mission and are literally the only two people up there? If David owned a gun, this whole episode doesn't happen. All it took was 4 people with hammers and knives and they took down half of the team aboard this spaceship, which in the 1960s was likely the most sophisticated thing all of humanity had ever created. 

I know it's a minor complaint, but it's the event that sets the entire plot into motion. Most of this season had little things like this, unfortunately.",Neutral,Mixed,High,,,

As someone who has gone through multiple therapists and depressive episodes, I really recognize myself in your description.

The dismissive attitude towards positive things is something a friend told me; she said that I ignore my good things and later someone else suggested that I write down all the positive things I do and what others tell me.

">Daly was a god in his virtual prison—it's peculiar that he would die so easily.

I think it was worth noting that Daly, in all his forms, seemed to think of himself as above others, especially women, so he probably wouldn't think of Nanette as a threat to his existence, especially after he'd spent what seemed like 500 years manipulating everything around him. So his defenses are down and she has the surprise on her side.

I think if Brooker had wanted to convey that Daly escaped in some form there would have been more direct clues, but I wouldn't be surprised if he's leaving it open in case of a third installment.

As it stands, I interpret the ending as Daly is dead dead dead, Nanette is a combination of her natural self and her digital clone, and her surviving mates are stuck trapped in her consciousness until she figures a way to get them out - which she may do eventually but right now she just wants a break from having to work for everyone's survival 24/7.

I don't have a good answer to the cellphone question. Maybe in the hospital Nanette was hooked up to some sort of brainwave monitor that... I don't know.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
"I loved this episode, but... How would Robert/Bob slave could see the camera of the hospital but never in those '500 years as slave' didn't watch the real world through other cameras?

Also, Nanette at the end put the blue disk (the 3rd option) into the PC. How is that they are in her head and not in their normal bodies as her?

Besides that, I very liked the continuation and the humorous part despite all the drama. I got the Cast Away reference with Wilson (now Rocky) immediately.

Edit: i remembered the Metallica part, saying Exit Sandman instead of Enter Sandman. Basic joke but pretty funny and out of context.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
"I thought that was a very interesting insight and I related to it as well. Loch Henry also had a bit about how people only want to watch the most awful shit.

He at least *perceived* that he had more invested in the relationship than she did (even if that wasn't actually so) and it was this cognitive bias that led him to frame that memory the way he did for years. A loss that profound, even if essentially self-inflicted (as we find out in the end), could well lead to depression and alcoholism as happened with Phillip. One coping strategy he seems to have settled on in the years that followed was to place an undue amount of blame on Carol.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
The amount of corporate bullshit in that episode - so real tbh,Neutral,Weak,Medium,,,
"I actually disagree. Part of what made Eulogy work for me was that the baby wasn’t his.

That absence of connection made the whole situation feel even more alienating and haunting. It reinforced the themes of memory, legacy, and how much (or little) we actually mean to others in the end.

If the baby had been his, it would have shifted the story toward closure and reconciliation, which isn’t really the point of the episode. The coldness of that final reveal hits harder because there's no redemptive twist, it’s just empty. And that's why the scene with him crying, looking at her playing the cello is so much more bittersweet because he knows that this is just something that can't be reconciled. 

It's showing that as much as we can use technology to go back to the past, you can't really go back to fully change the real world and what happened in it, and you can't escape what happened even if you tried to be as thorough as possible and cut out all memories of somebody. It's showing that trauma will still exist and it's up to you to decide how to move on. 

His reason for attending the funeral is to signify that he's moving on, and he's accepting that all that shit happened. He's closing the chapter on her, but opening himself up seeing a part of her life that he never got to see - the daughter and the people that were privy to what she was like before she was gone.",Positive,Strong,High,,,
They obviously are very serious about their job so I'd like to think what will happen after they get back to Earth. Will they immediately kill each other then?

Or will they fall in love and forget everything that had happened?,Neutral,Weak,Medium,,,

"There are a lot of Easter Eggs and tongue-in-cheek references to other episodes. I've never thought that they were indicators that episodes take place in the same universe, especially since each episode has its own distinct world and feel.

While more tame than the first two victims, it was exactly the same and he saved her. So why would he target people who were victims of the exact same thing?

"That's pretty much how the mind works. In cultures where female breasts aren't traditionally covered up, they aren't regarded as sexually relevant or any more taboo than a woman's hands. 

Basically, Sara developed obsessions with concepts that were literally censored by a chip in her brain. She can't see violence, so she's obsessed with it. She can't see drugs, so she wants to try them. She can't see sex,  so she couldn't wait to experience it. 

This is why the mom was advised by a psychiatrist to discontinue using the device, but they should have followed up with her. Since it's Black Mirror, they didn't account for a parent getting addicted to the ability to monitor and protect her child. And just because Sara stopped self-harming (she couldn't see blood, but *feeling it* appealed to her, and she might have been able to make out its color if she *drew a ton of blood)* doesn't mean her problems were over. For example, she found it appealing when a teenaged Trick wanted to show porn and extreme violence to a preteen girl, and later jumped at the chance to do drugs and have unprotected sex with Trick when she was 15, and he was probably 17-18.

The surveillance wasn't the only problem. The censoring created real developmental issues that made Sara high-grade reckless, and also apparently unaware of how contraception works.",Positive,Strong,High,,,

Nothing made sense about this episode to me. Even the premise “what if we could replace an actor from an old classic movie with a current popular actor” makes no sense because I can’t think of why anyone would care about or want to watch something like that. Especially given the fact there is currently already enough technology and CGI to do something like this in a much easier way. I just don’t see the appeal at all of the tech itself and then the way they handled the filming process also didn’t make sense at all. And the way they set up the plot was lazy to me where Issa was like “it’s so frustrating I can’t get any good roles where is my hotel reverie” and then conveniently they are looking to remake that exact movie at that exact time and her agent or whoever knows about it. And then the flash drive was supposed to explain everything but they filmed anyways after she didn’t watch it knowing they were throwing her into a very disorienting and confusing and overwhelming environment to do something she was not at all prepared to do. Also aren’t flash drives a bit outdated even in todays world? That bit of tech seemed out of place to me.
